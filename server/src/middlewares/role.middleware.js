// Why needed: This middleware manages role-based access control by checking user roles before allowing access to certain routes.
// In simple words, it restricts access to specific parts of the application based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

// When to use: Admin dashboard routes or any routes that require specific user roles for access.
